These C programs are some of the major ones I wrote when I was doing CS50x by Harvard on edx.

CS50 Pset4 -
recover.c  - is for recovering images from a digital camera memory card. 
bmph.c and resize.c - are for resizing a bmp image (increase by integral factor).

CS50 Pset5 -
Makefile - to make it easier to compile files.
dictionary.c and dictionary.h and speller.c - extract a big (100,000) words stored in file into memory as a trie data structure and then checks if a particular word exists in it or not and finally unloads (frees) the memory back.
